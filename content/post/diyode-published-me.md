You may have seen my article on the [air quality meter](https://kn100.me/aqi) I built a while ago. Diyode, a print magazine in Australia kindly published an article discussing the process I took to create the thing! It's a really cool feeling to be featured somewhere like this. The article is a great read, check it out over on Diyode: [Sense of Smell](https://diyodemag.com/features/sense_of_smell_esp32-based_air_quality_meter).
