# Hi, I'm Kevin!
I am a Software Engineer, currently working with <a href="https://mo.work/">Mo</a>, building out a Microservices architecture. Previously, I've worked with <a href="https://pusher.com/">Pusher</a>, scaling their flagship product, Channels.

I'm a friendly, driven, "get things done" engineer who finds enjoyment in delivering software that makes clients smile. I'm far more interested in solving real problems than I am faffing about with untested tools. I'm also a [proud Stem Cell donor](https://www.anthonynolan.org/).

# My interests
I am mainly interested in building next generation web applications and APIS. I currently enjoy:

* Golang
* Ruby/RoR
* Redis
* Distributed Systems work
* Java
* Linux administration
* Basic electronics/embedded systems (Arduino/Raspberry Pi, etc)
* Theme parks
