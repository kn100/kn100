<article class="post">
    <h1 class="title"> Initiative Q - Get Rich Quick in 2018?! </h1>
    <div class="content"> <p>I personally don&rsquo;t pay a massive amount of my attention to cryptocurrency. This isn&rsquo;t because I dislike them, more because they&rsquo;re just not that interesting to me at the moment. I&rsquo;ll occasionally hear about Bitcoin rallying or some Etherium app getting hacked, but other than that I avoid it.</p>
<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve had a bunch of people who wouldn&rsquo;t normally be interested in such things ping me about Initiative Q, asking what I thought of it. When people who aren&rsquo;t in the tech circles I&rsquo;m in start asking me about something like this, alarm bells start ringing for me, given that usually <em>we</em> tend to know about these things before they become popular. So I investigated.</p>
<p>Firstly, and I can&rsquo;t shout this loud enough:</p>
<h1 id="q-is-not-a-cryptocurrency">Q IS NOT A CRYPTOCURRENCY</h1>
<p>Q is a centralized coin. It is issued by a central authority, and right now isn&rsquo;t even traded. This makes it presently completely useless; not that being able to trade it gives it much more use.</p>
<p>Effectively, right now, the website is promising to give users who sign up today over 100,000 dollars. Of course, they mean in <strong>future</strong> money, once Q has gotten up and running and is worth anything at all. How the hell they&rsquo;re estimating the future worth of a currently worthless token is anybodies guess.</p>
<h1 id="q-does-not-solve-the-problem-it-claims-to">Q does not solve the problem it claims to</h1>
<p>Q claims that it has found a way to incentivize shop owners to install their payment infrastructure, but as far as I can tell, they reckon giving a bunch of people worthless tokens will somehow encourage shop owners to pay to install hardware so that they can take these pointless coins. I somehow doubt it.</p>
<p>If the number of users was the barrier to a shops adoption of a new currency, then why haven&rsquo;t we seen shops cashing in on Bitcoin or Etherium payment terminals? It wouldn&rsquo;t be that hard really to build a payment terminal that can accept a large array of CryptoCoins - and they&rsquo;ve all got the benefit of low/no fees and no central authority! Bitcoin in particular can do practically instant transactions using the lightning network these days too!</p>
<h1 id="it-smells-a-lot-of-a-pyramid-scheme">It smells a LOT of a pyramid scheme</h1>
<p>Their marketing literally begs you to get others to sign up, and if you get others to sign up then you get more money! It even in a hilariously self aware fashion explains that if not enough people sign up, the project will fail. Unfortunately for the authors of this nonsense, &lsquo;enough&rsquo;, means &lsquo;infinite&rsquo;.</p>
<h1 id="get-rich-quick-schemes-still-work">Get rich quick schemes still work</h1>
<p>What is surprising in all this to me is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users are visiting the homepage of this website, and are seeing a dollar amount promised to them in the future, if they just give their email now!!!</li>
<li>After signing up, they&rsquo;re being told that they&rsquo;ll get 10% of that amount in worthless tokens, but if they want another 40% worthless tokens, they better sign a few of their friends up!</li>
<li>Users then are spamming referral links all over the internet attempting to get others to sign up with their link.</li>
<li>Users don&rsquo;t see anything wrong with all this!</li>
</ul>
<p>Does this seem like a reputable scheme? A vicious threat to those fat cats at VISA and Mastercard? &ldquo;If only you&rsquo;d share your referral link one more time we could have defeated HSBC :(&rdquo;. &ldquo;Like my Facebook page to take down AMEX&rdquo;. &ldquo;Share this with 10 of your friends or Western Union will come into your house and mess up your pots and pans&rdquo;. I doubt they&rsquo;re losing any sleep over this nonsense.</p>
<p>How about a ponzi scheme to collect a bunch of emails for people who are interested in futuristic Fintech to exploit later? Seems a bit more likely to me, but hey, what do I know, I missed out on my Bitcoin millions.</p>
