Over the last couple of years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to reduce my dependence on cloud services. This is purely ideological, I have no real reason to distrust the cloud, nor am I going to attempt to convince you to. I just made a decision a while ago that all my mission critical/sensitive stuff needed to be moved off of centralised cloud storage.</description>

Bluetooth Audio is generally considered convenient, but not &amp;lsquo;audiophile&amp;rsquo;. Any self respecting audiophile is probably connecting their fancy headphones to some Digital to Analog Converter/Amp combo which might be connected to their computer using some fancy gold plated USB Cable. More power to them, I am not self respecting. I made a decision a few months ago to switch entirely to Bluetooth Audio as the convenience and tidiness of having a wireless headset just appealed to me so much.</description>

      <description>I recently installed Pop!_OS on my new desktop machine and have been loving it, but have been suffering with this really strange issue where the entire UI would stutter roughly every second for a few milliseconds. This got really, really annoying so I had a little dig around and found out the cause was actually a strange interaction between Ubuntu AppIndicator (a bundled extension for Gnome Shell in Pop!_OS) and YTMDesktop - an electron wrapper for Youtube Music.</description>
