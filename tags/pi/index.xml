Over the last couple of years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to reduce my dependence on cloud services. This is purely ideological, I have no real reason to distrust the cloud, nor am I going to attempt to convince you to. I just made a decision a while ago that all my mission critical/sensitive stuff needed to be moved off of centralised cloud storage.</description>

      <description>This is a description of how this blog is currently hosted. Hopefully, I&amp;rsquo;d like to do more interesting stuff with the Pi and post about it here.
Hardware The system currently hosting this blog is a Raspberry Pi 3b+. This is the (at the current time) latest revision of the single board computer, and features a slightly higher clock rate over the 3b, as well as better network performance. This is attached to a pretty standard 2 amp capable wall wart.</description>
