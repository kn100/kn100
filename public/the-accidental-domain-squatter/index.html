<article class="post">
    <h1 class="title"> That Time a Sticker Made Me an Accidental Domain Squatter </h1>
    <div class="content"> <p>It all started with my noticing of these stickers absolutely everywhere all over London. I&rsquo;d also seen them in other European cities. I was never curious enough to actually search for it, so I just noticed and moved on. The method by which I discovered their true meaning was something I never expected.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/whysuspectus-sticker.png"
         alt="The sticker in question"/> <figcaption>
            <p>The sticker in question</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Every now and then I&rsquo;d come across one and the question would briefly pop back into my head, but it&rsquo;s surprising how high the barrier to looking something up is for me. My curiosity came back more intensely after my girlfriend pointed one out and said that she&rsquo;d pondered the question herself for a long time. She&rsquo;d also seen them around, but once again hadn&rsquo;t been curious enough to search for it. I wonder how obscure something has to be before it drops below this curiosity barrier?</p>
<p>Furious searching resulted in a discovery of a Twitter account along with some rather confused discussions online regarding the sticker. I also noticed the domain whysuspectus.com being free to register.</p>
<p>I registered the domain, thinking that it was a shame for these stickers to be everywhere with the domain being free to register. I rarely buy frivolous domains, but this one just stood out to me for some reason. I bought it on a whim. I didn&rsquo;t really do anything interesting with it. I set up something cute for my girlfriend and also made it point to my CV, because I wasn&rsquo;t sure what else to do with it.</p>
<p>I forgot about it for a few months. In the back of my head, I wondered if the original owner of the domain would notice or whether they&rsquo;d totally forgotten about their attempt at viral marketing.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I got an email from someone who I will refer to as Steve (all details scrubbed out of request for the artist in question!).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey Kevin,
My name is Steve, I’m a $age year old artist from $area.
In 2011 I designed the Why Suspect Us logo
In January 2017 I created a website at <a href="http://www.whysuspectus.com">www.whysuspectus.com</a> to sell t-shirts and art for my brand using my why suspect us logo.
The shirts didn’t sell.
I dropped out of university, worked really, really hard, full time as a $servicejob for a year and a half so that I could travel around Europe working hard, putting up stickers.
While traveling the credit card attached to the domain name expired and I see that you’ve since registered <a href="http://www.whysuspectus.com">www.whysuspectus.com</a>
I’m a struggling young artist in 2019 and its painful, gut wrenching and heartbreaking to see someone else take control of the domain name.
I am appealing to you to pass me back the domain I have spent several years curating - I am happy to compensate you for costs of transferring and hope you can appreciate my anguish at the current situation.
Thank you,
Steve</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I saw this email, I was pretty gobsmacked. I assumed whoever had done all this had just forgotten all about it. I also assumed that even if they&rsquo;d noticed, they&rsquo;d do nothing but chuckle about the silly use of the domain.</p>
<p>After laughing for a bit, I replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Steve,
I had a feeling you might contact me! I&rsquo;m Kevin, an engineer from London. It&rsquo;s nice to hear from you.
I bought this domain after I wondered what the hell these stickers were everywhere. It seemed a shame to let a domain with stickers all over Europe go to some domain squatter, so I purchased it and set up some silly stuff with it.
I&rsquo;ll make you a deal! I will transfer the domain to you free of charge, in return for a few of those stickers. I&rsquo;d also love an explanation as to what &ldquo;why suspect us&rdquo; means - if it has a meaning! it&rsquo;s good for at least the next 10 months. To do this, You&rsquo;ll need to register a Namecheap account and provide me the email you used.
You should consider yourself very lucky! A domain squatter would have asked for hundreds if not thousands. I highly recommend renewing your domains if you intend to keep them - even if you&rsquo;re not using them. I&rsquo;ve lost domains to squatters and it sucks.
Thanks,
Kevin</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Almost immediately after I get a reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Kevin,
Thank you so much! It really means alot to me. Very lucky you&rsquo;re a good guy
I have made an account with namecheap using this email address:
<a href="mailto:steve@some-email.com">steve@some-email.com</a>
And yes! Where would you like the stickers sent!
I also have a few custom WSU T-shirts, what size can i send you?
Thank you Kevin I really appreciate it
Steve
Stickers on their way!

</blockquote>
<p>Past this point I verified the persons ownership of the domain via a method I won&rsquo;t talk about here and transferred Steve the domain.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, I received my shirt, as promised.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/whysuspectus-tshirt.jpg"/> 
</figure>

<p>In this story, the original owner of that domain got incredibly lucky that a domain squatter didn&rsquo;t extort him. I have lost domains to squatters and it absolutely sucks. Domain squatting should be made illegal. In this case, the squatter happened to be a curious engineer who didn&rsquo;t want to let an opportunity pass by.</p>
<p>This makes me wonder whether domains are &lsquo;too&rsquo; easy to purchase. The fact that within 10 minutes I was able to squat a persons previous business could have been incredibly harmful. Imagine if I&rsquo;d used the domain for naughty purposes!</p>
<p>This story has little point, but was an interesting interaction and answered the question I had all along. It&rsquo;s a T-shirt brand! The artist in question seems to have decided to stop selling them now though, so if you&rsquo;d like one give the author a bell! <a href="https://whysuspectus.bigcartel.com/products">https://whysuspectus.bigcartel.com/products</a></p>
